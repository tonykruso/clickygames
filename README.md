Overview
This is a simple but addictive (and serverless) memory game built using React. It relies and CSS animations and the app's state to shuffle around the images available for clicking.

See a live example here: https://github.com/tonykruso/clickygames. Please enjoy!

Technologies Used:
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, and so requires npm/yarn.
I am also using the CDN version of Bootstrap 4.
